Hi! I'm a hobbyist programmer and a 2nd-year CS student studying at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/)‚≠ê  
  
I'm self-taught in Python and TypeScript, and working on [side projects](https://github.com/reddwiz?tab=repositories) right now.  
If you'd like to work on something with me, please let me know!
